											<h2>Club Projects</h2>
											<p>Coding as a group</p>
										</header>
										<p>
										    The CS Club at Western has several group projects. We use these as a way to learn to work as a team, and
                                            allow for all of our members to feel as though they are working in something bigger.

                                            </header>
                                            <p>
                                                This very website is a group project! We decided to use a template for the website source, and work the
                                                website as a Github repository. There's a link in the sidebar that leads to the Github repo. If you have
                                                additions you want to make to the website, create a pull request! Once approved, it will appear here on
                                                the website at around midnight.
                                            </p>

												<h3>The Touchmeister</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
											    The Touchmeister is a mock arcade video game machine. We currently run a few older public domain video
                                                games on it, but one of the CS Club projects is to extend it to be an open framework for club members
                                                to develop games on. This project is slowly being worked on.
